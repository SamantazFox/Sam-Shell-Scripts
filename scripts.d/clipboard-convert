#
# Convert clipboard content to/from base 64.
# This sript is intended for use in addition of barrier, a software that
# permits keyboard, mouse and clipboard sharing across computers.
#
# Barrier doesn't support sharing of binary data in the clipboard, hence these
# two functions. Of course, they're required on every machine, and some
# .desktop files may be added for convenience.
